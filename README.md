# 05-PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
This Pyber Analysis is to show the ride share data between the Urban, Suburban and Rural areas based on fares. 
 

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on City and Fares

The data does not specifiy that in the Rural setting that the need is not needed or there aren't enough cars in the area to make the trip easier. It is possible that the wait for the car to arrive from the Urban/Suburban setting too long and the user opts for another ride sharing app or they find a different method of transportation.

The data could also be narrowed down to number of riders in each setting to show how many subscribe to the service.

It could be beneficial to narrow down the time of day each ride is taken.  Then cars could be spread more appropriatly in the different settings. For example, if more people use it during the day in the suburban setting, but not in the urban, it would make more sense to have cars more avaiable in the suburban setting to reduce wait times for the car to arrive. 


## Results
In the months of January thru April, the anaylsis follows weekly totals of fares for the Urban, Suburban and Rural areas.  The data shows that every week the Urban setting has the highest fares, followed by Suburban and then Rural.
